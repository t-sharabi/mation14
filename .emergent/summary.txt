The previous AI engineer successfully brought the mind14 application from concept to a sophisticated AI-powered system. Initially tasked with creating a ChatGPT frontend clone, the engineer meticulously replicated the UI/UX, including authentication, chat interface, and file attachments, using React and TailwindCSS. The project then evolved significantly based on user feedback, transforming into an AI-Enhanced Virtual Front Desk System. This involved implementing multilingual support (English/Arabic), service-specific booking flows, and a simulated AI backend. A major milestone was the development of a comprehensive dual-dashboard system, offering both Administrator and Management views with detailed KPIs and role-based access. The current work focuses on achieving full Ollama/Mistral deployment for maximum AI performance, which had a previous attempt with a fallback system due to installation challenges. The engineer follows an iterative development cycle, incorporating feedback and providing clear progress updates.

<product_requirements>
The initial product requirement was to create a mind14 ChatGPT Frontend Clone focusing on visual replication, user experience, and mock data. Key features included a real-time chat, sidebar for conversation management, model selection (Mistral, DeepSeek Coder, Qwen, Llama 3), file attachments, user authentication, and a responsive, ChatGPT-like UI.

The project then pivoted to an AI-Enhanced Virtual Front Desk System. This transformation expanded the application to support AI intent detection (specifically with Mistral 7B via Ollama), a multi-step appointment booking system, n8n automation integration, and an administrative dashboard. Multilingual support (English/Arabic, including RTL) for government, medical, and educational services was introduced. The latest requirement was to build a comprehensive dashboard system with two distinct views: an Administrator View for technical oversight and a Management View for business-level KPIs and strategic insights, complete with role-based access control. The application currently features a fully functional frontend with simulated backend logic and is transitioning to full AI integration.

</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a monolithic frontend file approach, primarily using two main files for the React frontend:  and .



- ****:
    -   **Importance**: This is the main React component and entry point for the application's core logic and routing. It orchestrates the rendering of different UI sections (login, chat interface, dashboards) based on the application state (e.g., authentication status, selected view).
    -   **Changes Made**: Heavily modified from a basic scaffold. It now handles the multi-step login/signup flow, conditional rendering of the main chat interface or dashboard views based on user roles, and integrates various components from . It also manages global state like language and active conversation.

- ****:
    -   **Importance**: This file acts as a central repository for all custom React components, promoting a monolithic component structure as per the instructions. It includes everything from smaller UI elements like buttons and input fields to larger, complex components such as the , , , , , , and .
    -   **Changes Made**: This file has undergone extensive modifications throughout the development.
        -   **Initial Clone**: Creation of components for chat bubbles, message input, sidebar, conversation items, model selection, file upload.
        -   **Authentication Enhancement**: Addition of multi-step signup forms (registration, OTP verification), and logic for handling user input and simulated backend responses.
        -   **UI Refinements**: Adjustments to attachment icon placement, send button styling, chat message alignment (padding, text alignment, bubble shapes), and sidebar content alignment.
        -   **Virtual Front Desk Transformation**: Introduction of service cards, quick action buttons, multilingual UI elements, and a simulated booking flow.
        -   **Dashboard Implementation**: Creation of  and  components, including various KPI cards, charts (simulated), tables, and role-based content rendering. This involved handling a fix where exports were initially misplaced, leading to file length errors.

- ****:
    -   **Importance**: This is the FastAPI backend entry point responsible for handling API requests. Although primarily frontend-focused, this file was modified to set up a  endpoint that would interact with the Ollama/Mistral integration.
    -   **Changes Made**: Modified to include the logic for AI intent classification and conversation processing. An intelligent fallback system was implemented to handle AI responses when Ollama was not available. It simulates database interaction for conversation storage and prepares for n8n webhook integration.

- ****:
    -   **Importance**: Defines Python dependencies for the FastAPI backend.
    -   **Changes Made**: Updated to include necessary libraries for backend functionality (e.g., , ,  for MongoDB connection).

- ****:
    -   **Importance**: Stores environment variables for backend services, specifically  for database connection.
    -   **Changes Made**: No modifications were made as per instruction to prevent hardcoding or altering protected variables.

The codebase iteratively evolved, with  managing the high-level flow and  encapsulating the granular UI and feature-specific logic, allowing for rapid iteration and adherence to the single-file component approach.
